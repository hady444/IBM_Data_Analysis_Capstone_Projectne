# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset to gain insights and make data-driven recommendations.

##Project Overview
The goal of this capstone project is to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. The project involves working with a real-world dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, applying data cleaning techniques, conducting statistical analysis, and creating visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is titled "Sales Performance Data" and is provided in the data directory. The dataset contains information about sales transactions, including customer demographics, sales revenue, product categories, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:

.
├── data
│   └── sales_data.csv
├── notebooks
│   ├── 01_data_exploration.ipynb
│   ├── 02_data_cleaning.ipynb
│   ├── 03_data_analysis.ipynb
│   └── 04_visualizations.ipynb
├── reports
│   └── final_report.pdf
└── README.md
The data directory contains the dataset file sales_data.csv.
The notebooks directory includes Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate the step-by-step analysis and code implementation.
The reports directory contains the final project report summarizing the findings and recommendations in PDF format.
The README.md file provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information about the repository structure.
Usage
To replicate the project and run the code locally, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ibm-data-analyst-capstone.git
Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib) installed.

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the notebooks directory.

## Execute the notebooks in the following order:

01_data_exploration.ipynb: Perform initial data exploration and understanding.
02_data_cleaning.ipynb: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
03_data_analysis.ipynb: Conduct statistical analysis and derive insights from the data.
04_visualizations.ipynb: Create visualizations to communicate the analysis results effectively.
Refer to the final project report in the reports directory for a summary of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
